A Javascript experiment to dissect mobile Twitter usage on Grand Cayman

This is a completely non-scientific Javascript "experiment" to analyse the mobile users as mapped out by Twitter and GNIP. First of all we created a a composite of the map tiles in Photoshop for Grand Cayman, Barbados and Kingston (Jamaica is huge) and its these images we analyse to find what devices are most prevalent. We go through every pixel ignoring those that are black or grayscale. The rest are run through basic color analysis methods to try to categorise the device type.
